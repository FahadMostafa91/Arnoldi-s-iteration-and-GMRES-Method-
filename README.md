# Arnoldi-s-iteration-and-GMRES-Method-
it is common to seek a solution x minimizing r(x)=‖y-Ax‖^2 , where AϵR^(n×n). Let the initial guess x_0=0 them the residual vector is r0=y. We can use GMRES method for solving y = Ax, using Krylov subspaces κ_m, where Arnoldi’s iteration has been applied to find orthonormal basis for κ_m,for all m=1,2,…
